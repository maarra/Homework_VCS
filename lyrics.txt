Bicycle Race
Queen

Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle 11
I want to ride my bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle 22
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle 33
I want to ride it where I like
You say black, I say white 44
You say bark, I say bite
You say shark, I say hey man 66
Jaws was never my scene
And I don't like Star Wars
You say Rolls, I say Royce
You say God give me a choice
You say Lord, I say Christ
I don't believe in Peter Pan
Frankenstein or Superman
All I wanna do is
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
